# Repo Hygiene and Local Context Rules

## 1) Keep paths.txt fresh
- After **any** file/folder add/remove/rename, run:
```
./scripts/dir.bat
```
- Consumers must resolve paths from:
```
./paths.txt
```

## 2) Local documentation (authoritative)
- When inferring APIs, **use local docs** first:
```
./documentation/
```
- Especially for raster export:
```
./documentation/Classes/wssimobject.md
```
- Do **not** guess method names or keys; mirror the signature from the local docs.

## 3) Local examples (preferred patterns)
- Reuse patterns from local examples:
```
./examples/
```
- For raster export usage, consult:
```
./examples/ExportRaster2D_IExchange.rb
```

## 4) Engine
- Headless ICMExchange execution path:
```
./output/Release.x64/ICMExchange.exe
```

## 5) Git etiquette (before committing generated assets)
- Ensure `./paths.txt` is updated (`./scripts/dir.bat`).
- Commit only essential generated artifacts (e.g., minimal rasters/metrics for reproducibility).
