### Description

This section focuses on the **0018 - Create Selection list using a SQL query** directory under the `02 SWMM` folder, which contains scripts and files for creating selection lists using SQL queries within SWMM:

- **Transportable File:** `2021.4.1 Transportable.icmt` is likely a transportable file for InfoWorks ICM, possibly used for testing or demonstration purposes in the context of SQL query operations.
- **Visual Aid:** `gif001.gif` might be a GIF animation showing how to use one of the scripts or the result of a SQL query selection.
- **Documentation:** `Readme.md` provides documentation or instructions for the tools within this directory.
- **Scripts:**
  - `UI_Script_Select links sharing the same us and ds node ids.rb` is a script designed to select links that share the same upstream (us) and downstream (ds) node IDs, which can be useful for network analysis or data cleanup.
  - `UI_Script.rb` could be a general UI script or a base script for user interface interactions related to SQL query operations.
  - `UI_CreateSelectionList.rb` is specifically for creating selection lists using SQL queries, facilitating the extraction or management of data based on specific criteria.
  - `UI_Reports-CreateIndividualForSelection_folder.rb` and `UI_Reports-CreateIndividualForSelection.rb` are scripts for generating individual reports for selections, with one possibly handling folder operations.
  - `UI_SelectIsolatedNodes.rb` is used to select nodes that are isolated in the network, which might be useful for identifying errors or for specific analysis in network topology.

### Usage

To use the scripts within the `0018 - Create Selection list using a SQL query` directory:

1. **Environment Setup:** Ensure Ruby is installed on your system.
2. **Navigation:** Navigate to the `0018 - Create Selection list using a SQL query` subdirectory under `02 SWMM`.
3. **Execution:** Run the Ruby scripts from the command line or integrate them into your workflow for creating selection lists or managing data with SQL queries.

For example, to select links sharing the same upstream and downstream node IDs:
```sh
ruby UI_Script_Select links sharing the same us and ds node ids.rb

Note
Always check for permissions before running scripts that might access or modify your model data.
Backup your data before executing scripts that could alter or process datasets extensively.
The Readme.md file within this directory might contain specific instructions, notes, or prerequisites for running these SQL query tools.
