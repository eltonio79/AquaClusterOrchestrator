This Ruby script is designed to export data for selected `hw_subcatchment` objects from a hydraulic modeling software environment (likely InfoWorks ICM or a similar platform that uses `WSApplication`) into a CSV file.

Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

**1. Dependencies:**
* `csv`: For CSV file generation and manipulation.
* `fileutils`: For file system operations like creating directories.

**2. Configuration:**
* **`FIELDS_TO_EXPORT` Constant:** This is a crucial array that defines all the potential fields from a `hw_subcatchment` object that can be exported.
    * Each entry in the array is another array specifying:
        1.  A descriptive label for the field (used in the UI).
        2.  A Ruby symbol representing the attribute/method name on the `hw_subcatchment` object.
        3.  A boolean indicating whether the field should be selected for export by default.
        4.  The header name for the column in the output CSV file.
    * It includes a comprehensive list of subcatchment properties, from basic identifiers (like `subcatchment_id`, `x`, `y`) and area details to complex hydrological parameters, model-specific attributes (ReFH, SRM, ARMA, RAFTS), wastewater data, groundwater interaction, land use, and user-defined fields.
    * Top-level flag fields are generally excluded from this list.

**3. Core Logic & Workflow:**
* **Network Connection:**
    * It first attempts to get the currently loaded network object using `WSApplication.current_network`.
    * Exits with an error if no network is loaded or if `WSApplication` is not found (indicating the script isn't run in the correct environment).
* **Optional Debugging Block:**
    * Contains commented-out code that, if enabled, would print all available methods and fields for the first `hw_subcatchment` object found in the network. This is helpful for verifying the correct attribute symbols used in `FIELDS_TO_EXPORT`.
* **User Interaction (Prompts):**
    * The script uses `WSApplication.prompt` to display a dialog to the user.
    * Users are asked to:
        * Specify an output folder for the CSV file.
        * Select/deselect all fields for export via a master checkbox.
        * Individually select or deselect each field listed in `FIELDS_TO_EXPORT`.
    * If the user cancels this dialog, the script exits.
* **File Setup:**
    * Validates that an export folder is provided.
    * Creates the export folder if it doesn't exist.
    * Constructs a unique CSV filename using a timestamp (e.g., `selected_hw_subcatchments_export_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv`).
* **Field Processing:**
    * Based on user selections, it builds a list of `selected_fields_config` (containing attribute symbols and header names) and a `header` array for the CSV.
    * If no fields are selected, the script exits.
* **Data Export Loop:**
    * Opens the generated CSV file for writing.
    * Writes the determined header row.
    * Iterates through all `hw_subcatchment` objects in the current network (`cn.row_objects('hw_subcatchment')`).
    * For each subcatchment object:
        * It checks if the object is marked as `selected` (presumably by the user in the application's UI).
        * If selected, it proceeds to extract data for each field chosen by the user.
        * **Attribute Access:** Uses `sc_obj.send(attr_sym)` to dynamically call the method corresponding to the attribute symbol to get its value.
        * **Special Formatting for Complex Fields:**
            * `:lateral_links`: Formats an array of link objects into a semicolon-separated string of "NodeID,Suffix,Weight" sets.
            * `:boundary_array`: Formats an array of points into a semicolon-separated string of "X,Y" coordinates.
            * `:suds_controls`: Formats an array of SUDS control objects into a semicolon-separated string, with each SUDS control's key attributes (ID, structure, type, area, num_units) joined by commas.
            * `:swmm_coverage`: Formats an array of SWMM coverage objects into a semicolon-separated string of "LandUse,Area" pairs.
            * `:refh_descriptors`: If the value is a Hash, it's formatted as "key:value;..." pairs. If it's another type of object, it falls back to `value.to_s`.
            * `:hyperlinks`: Formats an array of hyperlink objects into a semicolon-separated string of "Description,URL" pairs.
            * Other general arrays are converted to comma-separated strings.
            * Values that might contain CSV delimiters (`;`, `,`) are cleaned.
        * **Error Handling (Attribute Level):**
            * If an attribute (method) listed in `FIELDS_TO_EXPORT` is not found on a subcatchment object (`NoMethodError`), a warning is printed, and "AttributeMissing" is written to the CSV cell.
            * Other errors during attribute access result in an error message and "AccessError" in the cell.
        * The processed row of data is then written to the CSV file.
* **Post-Processing & Summary:**
    * After iterating through all objects, it prints a summary to the console:
        * Total subcatchments iterated.
        * Number of selected subcatchments successfully written to the CSV.
    * If no subcatchments were written (either none selected or an issue occurred):
        * It checks if the created CSV file is empty or contains only the header.
        * If so, the empty/header-only file is deleted to avoid clutter.
    * Displays a final summary dialog (`WSApplication.prompt` or `WSApplication.message_box`) to the user, showing:
        * The full path to the exported CSV file (if created and not empty).
        * The number of selected subcatchments written.
        * The number of fields exported per subcatchment.
        * Informative messages if no data was exported or if an issue occurred.
* **Overall Error Handling:**
    * Includes `rescue` blocks for common issues like permission errors when creating directories or writing files (`Errno::EACCES`), disk space errors (`Errno::ENOSPC`), CSV formatting errors (`CSV::MalformedCSVError`), and other generic exceptions during the export process.

In essence, this script provides a flexible way for users of a hydraulic modeling application to extract a custom set of data for selected subcatchments into an easily shareable and analyzable CSV format, with specific handling for complex data structures.
