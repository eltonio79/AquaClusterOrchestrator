### Description

This project directory contains scripts and documentation related to Ruby for HydroWorks (HW) and Storm Water Management Model (SWMM). The `01 Ruby` and `01 InfoWorks` folders likely contain foundational scripts or documentation for Ruby programming in the context of InfoWorks.

The `02 SWMM` directory delves into more specific statistical analysis scripts for various elements and fields within SWMM:

- **Element and Field Statistics:** This subdirectory includes a variety of Ruby scripts designed to extract and analyze different parameters within SWMM models, such as:
  - Link, Node, and Subcatchment parameters
  - Pipe diameter and length statistics
  - User number statistics for links and nodes
  - Depression storage statistics
  - 2D parameter statistics specific to InfoWorks

Additionally, there are visual aids (`How it works.png`, `image.png`) and a markdown file (`Pipe Length Histogram.md`) which might provide explanations or results visualizations for the scripts.

### Usage

To use these scripts, you would typically:
1. Ensure you have Ruby installed on your system.
2. Navigate to the appropriate directory.
3. Run the Ruby scripts from the command line or integrate them into your workflow with SWMM or InfoWorks.

### Note

- Ensure you have the necessary permissions and environment setup to run these scripts.
- Always backup your data before running new scripts, especially when dealing with statistical analysis which might alter or process large datasets.

This README provides a structure based on the directory listing in the image, offering a brief on what each script might be used for and general usage instructions. If there's any specific detail or additional context you want to include, please let me know!
