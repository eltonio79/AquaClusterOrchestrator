 
One playful, unofficial expansion for the acronym **WAYNE** in the context of modeling buildup and washoff in SWMM5:

# WAYNE: Waterflow Accumulation and Washoff Network Engine**

## Explanation:**

## Waterflow:** Emphasizes the central role of water movement in dislodging and transporting accumulated materials. AKA Runoff in SWMM5
## Accumulation:** Refers to the buildup of sediments and pollutants on urban surfaces over time.
## Washoff:** Highlights the process by which these accumulated materials are mobilized during runoff events.
## Network:** Indicates that the model simulates these processes throughout the drainage system.
## Engine:** Connotes a robust computational framework that drives the simulation of water-related buildup and washoff dynamics.
