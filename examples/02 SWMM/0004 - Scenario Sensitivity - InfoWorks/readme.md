This README now focuses exclusively on the `0004 - Scenario Sensitivity - InfoWorks` folder, detailing its contents and usage.  


# Extended Markdown Summary for the “Scenario Sensitivity Parameter” Ruby Script

Below is an extended documentation and commentary for a **Ruby script** that interacts with an InfoWorks ICM (or equivalent InfoWorks WS) network to **create and manage scenarios** based on adjusting infiltration parameters. This script:
1. Prompts the user to choose between US or SI units (though currently, the script uses the prompt but does not apply it in subsequent logic).  
2. Deletes all existing scenarios except for “Base.”  
3. Creates new scenarios for various “percolation_coefficient” factors.  
4. Updates infiltration parameters in each newly created scenario.  

---

## 1. Purpose of the Script

This script’s **main goal** is to **automate scenario creation** for sensitivity testing. By applying different percentage factors (e.g., −25%, −10%, +10%, +25%) to a chosen parameter (`percolation_coefficient`), you can quickly evaluate how model results change under different infiltration assumptions.  

It also provides a basic user prompt (to select US or SI units) and displays helpful messages about the operations performed.

---

## 2. Prerequisites / Assumptions

1. You are **inside** InfoWorks ICM or a compatible Ruby environment that has access to `WSApplication` and the **current network** (`WSApplication.current_network`).  
2. You have **write access** to the current network so you can delete and add scenarios.  
3. Your infiltration parameters are stored in the **`hw_ground_infiltration`** table (or a similar table) for row objects.  
4. There is an existing **Base** scenario that you want to preserve.

---

## 3. Code Explanation

Below is the code with annotated comments to explain each section in detail:

```ruby
# Original Source https://github.com/ngerdts7/ICM_Tools123
# RED + CoPilot edits 

cn = WSApplication.current_network

# Step 1: Prompt user for unit selection
val = WSApplication.prompt "Scenario Sensitivity Parameter Selection",
[
  ['USA Units','Boolean',false],
  ['SI  Units','Boolean',true]
], false

THANK_YOU_MESSAGE1 = "That's it! You've successfully added scenarios your ICM InfoWorks network. Thank you for using our Ruby script."
THANK_YOU_MESSAGE2 = "If you have any questions or need further assistance, don't hesitate to reach out to the Autodesk EBCS Team."
THANK_YOU_MESSAGE3 = "Happy Modeling! or Happy Modelling! (depending on your location)"

# Define the factors for sensitivity testing
factors = [-0.25, -0.10, 0.10, 0.25]
parameters = ['percolation_coefficient']

# Generate scenario names for each (parameter, factor) combination
scenarios = parameters.product(factors).map do |parameter, factor|
  "#{parameter}_factor_#{(factor*100).to_i}"
end

# Step 2: Delete all existing scenarios except 'Base'
cn.scenarios do |scenario|
  if scenario != 'Base'
    cn.delete_scenario(scenario)
  end
end

puts "Operation successful! All scenarios, except for the base scenario, have been deleted and new scenarios have been added."
puts "If this action was performed in error, don't worry! You can easily revert these changes."
puts "Just go to the ICM Explorer Window and select 'Revert Changes' to restore the deleted scenarios."
puts

# Step 3: Create and modify each scenario
scenarios.zip(factors).each do |scenario, factor|
  # Add the new scenario
  cn.add_scenario(scenario, nil, '')
  cn.current_scenario = scenario
  cn.transaction_begin
  
  puts "The factor for scenario is #{factor}"
  
  # Step 4: Apply the factor to the infiltration row objects
  ro = cn.row_objects('hw_ground_infiltration').each do |ro|
    ro.percolation_coefficient = ro.percolation_coefficient * (1 + factor)
    ro.write
  end

  cn.transaction_commit
end

# Summary of the operation
puts "Number of scenarios added: #{scenarios.length}"
puts
puts THANK_YOU_MESSAGE1
puts THANK_YOU_MESSAGE2
puts THANK_YOU_MESSAGE3
```

### 3.1. User Prompt for Units

```ruby
val = WSApplication.prompt "Scenario Sensitivity Parameter Selection",
[
  ['USA Units','Boolean',false],
  ['SI  Units','Boolean',true]
], false
```
- **WSApplication.prompt**: Displays a dialog with two checkboxes: “USA Units” and “SI Units.”  
- Currently, the returned value (`val`) is **not** used later in the script to branch logic or change parameters—this could be expanded in the future if you want different infiltration defaults or scenario naming based on units.

### 3.2. Thank-You Messages

```ruby
THANK_YOU_MESSAGE1 = "...(text)..."
THANK_YOU_MESSAGE2 = "...(text)..."
THANK_YOU_MESSAGE3 = "...(text)..."
```
- These are simple strings for the script’s final output, providing user-friendly confirmation of completed actions.

### 3.3. Defining Factors and Parameters

```ruby
factors = [-0.25, -0.10, 0.10, 0.25]
parameters = ['percolation_coefficient']
```
- **`factors`**: A numeric array representing the **percentage changes** you want to test.  
  - `-0.25` = **–25%**  
  - `-0.10` = **–10%**  
  - `0.10`  = **+10%**  
  - `0.25`  = **+25%**  
- **`parameters`**: An array of **strings** referencing which fields (in infiltration row objects) you want to adjust. In this script, there’s only one: `percolation_coefficient`.  

You could expand this array if you want to test multiple fields, e.g. `['percolation_coefficient', 'soil_infiltration_rate']`.

### 3.4. Creating Scenario Names

```ruby
scenarios = parameters.product(factors).map do |parameter, factor|
  "#{parameter}_factor_#{(factor*100).to_i}"
end
```
- **`parameters.product(factors)`**: Produces all combinations, e.g., `[("percolation_coefficient", -0.25), ("percolation_coefficient", -0.10), ...]`.
- **`map`** block**: Converts each pair to a string like `"percolation_coefficient_factor_-25"`.  
- **Result**: A list of scenario names.

### 3.5. Deleting Existing Scenarios Except “Base”

```ruby
cn.scenarios do |scenario|
  if scenario != 'Base'
    cn.delete_scenario(scenario)
  end
end
```
- **Iterates** through all existing scenarios.  
- If the scenario name is not “Base,” it deletes it.  
- This ensures a “clean slate” before adding new scenarios.

### 3.6. Creating and Modifying Scenarios

```ruby
scenarios.zip(factors).each do |scenario, factor|
  cn.add_scenario(scenario, nil, '')
  cn.current_scenario = scenario
  cn.transaction_begin
  
  # ...
  
  cn.transaction_commit
end
```
- **`scenarios.zip(factors)`**: Pairs up each scenario name with its corresponding factor.  
- **`cn.add_scenario(scenario, nil, '')`**: Adds a new scenario.  
  - The `nil` and `''` arguments indicate no “parent scenario” and an empty description, respectively.  
- **`cn.current_scenario = scenario`**: Switches to the newly created scenario so changes affect this scenario’s row objects.  
- **`cn.transaction_begin/commit`**: Wraps row object modifications in a database transaction.

#### 3.6.1. Applying the Factor
```ruby
ro = cn.row_objects('hw_ground_infiltration').each do |ro|
  ro.percolation_coefficient = ro.percolation_coefficient * (1 + factor)
  ro.write
end
```
- **`cn.row_objects('hw_ground_infiltration')`**: Retrieves all infiltration row objects for the current scenario.  
- **Updates** the `percolation_coefficient` by `(1 + factor)`.  
  - Example: if factor = −0.25, each object’s coefficient becomes `coefficient * 0.75`. If factor = +0.25, it becomes `coefficient * 1.25`.  
- **`ro.write`**: Saves each updated row object change.

### 3.7. Final Output and Summary

```ruby
puts "Number of scenarios added: #{scenarios.length}"
puts
puts THANK_YOU_MESSAGE1
puts THANK_YOU_MESSAGE2
puts THANK_YOU_MESSAGE3
```
- Prints out how many scenarios were created and the thank-you messages to the console/log.

## 4. How to Use This Script

1. **Open** InfoWorks ICM and **load** the desired **ICM network**.  
2. **Ensure** your infiltration parameters are set correctly in the “Base” scenario.  
3. **Copy/Paste** this Ruby script into the **ICM Ruby Console** or a **.rb script file**.  
4. **Run** the script.  
5. A prompt will appear asking you to choose either “USA Units” or “SI Units.” (This doesn’t currently change the scenario logic, but might be a placeholder for future expansions.)  
6. The script will **delete** all existing scenarios except “Base.”  
7. The script will **create** new scenarios (e.g., `percolation_coefficient_factor_-25`, `percolation_coefficient_factor_-10`, etc.) and apply the infiltration multipliers.  
8. **Check** the scenario tree in ICM Explorer to see the newly created scenarios.  
9. **Revert Changes** if needed (to undo scenario deletions or changes).

## 5. Potential Customizations

1. **Include Additional Parameters**  
   - If you want to adjust other infiltration parameters (e.g., suction head, hydraulic conductivity), add them to the `parameters` array.  
   - You’d then need to adjust how you apply the factor to each parameter.  

2. **Different Factors**  
   - Adjust `factors` if you want different percentage changes, e.g., `[0.05, 0.10, 0.20]`.  

3. **Conditional Deletion**  
   - You might not want to delete all existing scenarios except “Base” every time. You could comment out or remove the deletion portion and create new scenarios in addition to existing ones.  

4. **Unit Selection**  
   - The current script doesn’t do anything with the user’s choice of US vs. SI units. You could incorporate logic that, for example, multiplies infiltration rates by different factors or uses a different parameter name if the user selects US.  

5. **Logging / Reporting**  
   - Instead of printing to the console, you could write changes to a log file or generate a user-facing report.

---

## 6. Troubleshooting Tips

- **No “Base” scenario found**: If your default scenario is named differently or you’re missing a “Base” scenario, you may need to adapt the deletion logic.  
- **No infiltration row objects**: If `cn.row_objects('hw_ground_infiltration')` returns an empty array, confirm that infiltration objects exist and that you’re in the correct layer or scenario.  
- **Inadvertent Data Loss**: Because the script deletes all non-“Base” scenarios, always make sure you want that action or create a **backup**. If you do it by mistake, use **“Revert Changes”** before saving.

---

## 7. Conclusion

This Ruby script is a powerful illustration of **programmatic scenario creation** and **parameter manipulation** within InfoWorks ICM. It streamlines the process of running **sensitivity analyses** on infiltration parameters by:

- **Resetting** the scenario list (except for “Base”).  
- **Creating** new scenarios for each factor combination.  
- **Modifying** infiltration row objects to reflect the factor changes.

Through modest extensions (such as adding more parameters or using the unit selection prompt), you can adapt it to meet various **hydraulic/hydrologic modeling** needs. Happy modeling!
