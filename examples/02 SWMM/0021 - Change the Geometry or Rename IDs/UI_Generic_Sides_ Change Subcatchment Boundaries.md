### **Summary of the Ruby Code (Markdown)**

#### **Overview**
This Ruby script is designed for **InfoWorks ICM** (or a similar hydraulic modeling application) and modifies the boundary shape of selected subcatchment polygons within a network. The script:
- Retrieves the current network.
- Begins a transaction to ensure changes are applied together.
- Iterates over selected subcatchments.
- Replaces each polygon's boundary with a new, **19-sided** polygon approximation.
- Commits the changes to the network.

---

### **Step-by-Step Breakdown**

#### **1. Retrieve the Current Network**
```ruby
net = WSApplication.current_network
```
- Gets the active hydraulic network in **InfoWorks ICM**.

#### **2. Start a Transaction**
```ruby
net.transaction_begin
```
- Starts a transaction so that all modifications are applied at once instead of incrementally.

#### **3. Generate a Polygon Boundary**
```ruby
def generate_polygon_boundary(boundary_array, sides)
```
- This function creates a polygon with a specified number of sides based on the existing polygon's bounding box.

##### **Key Steps in Polygon Generation:**
- Determines the **minimum and maximum x/y coordinates** of the original shape.
- Computes the **width and height** of the bounding box.
- Generates a new **regular polygon** (default: 19-sided) by distributing points evenly around a center.
- Ensures the new polygon is closed by repeating the first coordinate at the end.

#### **4. Iterate Over Selected Subcatchments**
```ruby
net.row_object_collection('hw_subcatchment').each do |polygon|
```
- Loops through all subcatchments in the hydraulic network.

#### **5. Modify the Boundary of Selected Subcatchments**
```ruby
if polygon.selected?
```
- Only modifies **selected** polygons.

```ruby
polygon.boundary_array = generate_polygon_boundary(boundary_array, sides)
polygon.write
```
- Calls `generate_polygon_boundary` to replace the original shape with a **19-sided** polygon.

#### **6. Commit Changes to the Network**
```ruby
net.transaction_commit
```
- Saves all changes permanently.

### **Key Features**
âœ… Uses **transaction control** to manage batch updates.  
âœ… Modifies **only selected** subcatchments.  
âœ… Replaces existing polygons with **regular 19-sided approximations**.  
âœ… Ensures polygons remain **closed** by repeating the first coordinate.

### **Potential Applications**
- **Generalization**: Converting complex subcatchments into simplified shapes.  
- **Data Cleaning**: Standardizing polygon shapes for analysis.  
- **Model Consistency**: Ensuring uniform boundary conditions in hydraulic models.
