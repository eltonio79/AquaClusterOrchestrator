# Summary of `hw_ui_script.rb`

## Overview
The script is designed to modify subcatchments within the current network in the WSApplication. It specifically targets the SWMM coverage of each subcatchment, setting the land use to "SWMM5_BW" and the area to 100.

## Steps Performed
1. **Access Current Network**: Attempts to access the current network. If not found, it raises an error.
2. **Transaction Begin**: Starts a transaction to bundle multiple changes into a single operation.
3. **Subcatchments Processing**:
   - Initializes a counter to track the number of subcatchments processed.
   - Iterates over each subcatchment in the current network.
   - For each subcatchment, it iterates over its SWMM coverage.
   - Sets the SWMM coverage's land use to "SWMM5_BW" and area to 100.
   - Writes the changes to the subcatchment.
   - Increments the counter after processing each subcatchment.
4. **Transaction Commit**: Commits the transaction, applying all changes made.
5. **Output**: Prints the number of subcatchments whose IDs were changed.

## Key Points
- The script ensures that changes are made within a transaction, enhancing data integrity and allowing rollback if necessary.
- It specifically modifies the SWMM coverage properties for each subcatchment, standardizing the land use and area.
- The script provides feedback on the number of subcatchments modified, aiding in tracking the script's impact.
