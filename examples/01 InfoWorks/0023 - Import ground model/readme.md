# Import ground model

This script is designed to import a ground model into a network from a grid file. This imported ground model can then be used in various geospatial analyses.

## How it Works

1. The script first opens the current database and selects a specific 'Model Group' in the database.
2. It creates an array of filenames (in this case, only one file is specified) which represent the grid files to import.
3. It creates a hash (a type of data structure) containing various properties for the new ground model such as name, data type, cell size, unit multipliers, whether the data is in integer format, and whether a boundary polygon should be used.
4. The 'importgridground_model' method of the 'Model Group' object is then called with the appropriate parameters: a polygon row object (in this case, none is specified), the array of filenames, and the hash of properties. This method imports the ground model from the specified grid file(s) with the specified properties.
5. The ground model, named 'fredi', is now available in the 'Model Group' for further use.
