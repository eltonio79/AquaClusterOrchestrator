## Code Summary: Updating IDs in an ICM InfoWorks Network

### Source
- The script is adapted from [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/chaitanyalakeshri/ruby_scripts).

### Purpose
The script is designed to update the IDs of various elements (nodes, links, subcatchments) within an ICM InfoWorks network.

### Process Flow

1. **Begin Block and Network Access**
   - The script starts with a `begin` block to handle exceptions.
   - It accesses the current network in ICM InfoWorks, raising an error if the network is not found.

2. **Starting a Transaction**
   - Begins a transaction in the network to ensure data integrity during the update process.

3. **Defining the Update Function**
   - `update_ids`: A function that updates the IDs of given row objects with a specified prefix and a sequential number.

4. **Fetching Row Objects**
   - Retrieves arrays of nodes (`_nodes`), links (`_links`), and subcatchments (`_subcatchments`) from the network.
   - Raises an error if any of these objects are not found.

5. **Updating IDs**
   - Calls the `update_ids` function to update the IDs of nodes, links, and subcatchments with specific prefixes ("N_", "L_", "S_").
   - Outputs the count of IDs changed for nodes and subcatchments. The line for updating link IDs is commented out.

6. **Committing the Transaction**
   - Commits the transaction to save the changes made to the network.

7. **Error Handling**
   - Catches and prints any errors that occur during the execution of the script.

### Functionality
- The script allows for a systematic and efficient update of element IDs within an ICM network.
- It ensures that all network elements have unique and standardized IDs, which is crucial for data management and analysis.

### Notes
- This tool is particularly useful for network administrators and engineers involved in managing and updating large ICM networks.
- The use of transactions and exception handling enhances the script's reliability and robustness.
