## Summary of the Code
This Ruby script connects selected subcatchments to the nearest node with the lowest ground level in a network. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what the code does:

## Initialize Network and Nodes Array:

The script starts by accessing the current network using WSApplication.current_network.
It initializes an empty array nodes to store information about selected nodes.
Collect Selected Nodes:

The script iterates over all nodes (hw_node) in the network.
For each selected node, it collects the node's ID, coordinates (x, y), system type, and ground level.
This information is stored in the nodes array.
Begin Transaction:

The script begins a transaction using net.transaction_begin.
It initializes a counter changed_nodes_count to keep track of how many subcatchments are updated.
Process Each Selected Subcatchment:

The script iterates over all subcatchments (hw_subcatchment) in the network.
For each selected subcatchment, it calculates the distance to each node and stores this information in an array nodes_with_distances.
Calculate Distances and Sort Nodes:

For each node, it calculates the Euclidean distance from the subcatchment.
It stores the node's ID, distance, system type, and ground level in the nodes_with_distances array.
The nodes are then sorted based on distance.
Select Nearest 5 Nodes:

The script selects the nearest 5 nodes from the sorted list.
Find Node with Lowest Ground Level:

Among the nearest 5 nodes, it finds the node with the lowest ground level.
Update Subcatchment:

If a node with the lowest ground level is found, the subcatchment's node_id is updated to this node's ID.
The changed_nodes_count is incremented.
The subcatchment is written back to the network.
Commit Transaction:

The script commits the transaction using net.transaction_commit.
Output:

Finally, it prints the number of subcatchments that were updated.
Example Output
The script includes commented-out lines that, if uncommented, would print the sorted nodes and their ground levels for debugging purposes.

## Conclusion
This script automates the process of connecting subcatchments to the nearest node with the lowest ground level, ensuring efficient and accurate network updates.
