# Water System Network Processing Script Summary

## Purpose
This script processes nodes and subcatchments in a ICM network, assigning nearest nodes to subcatchments based on various criteria.

## Key Components

1. **Network Initialization**
   ```ruby
   net = WSApplication.current_network
   ```
   - Retrieves the current network.

2. **Node Collection**
   ```ruby
   nodes = Array.new
   net.row_object_collection('hw_node').each do |n|
     # ... node processing ...
   end
   ```
   - Collects selected nodes and their properties (id, x, y, system_type).

3. **Transaction Management**
   ```ruby
   net.transaction_begin
   # ... main processing ...
   net.transaction_commit
   ```
   - Wraps the main processing in a transaction for data integrity.

4. **Subcatchment Processing**
   ```ruby
   net.row_object_collection('hw_subcatchment').each do |s|
     # ... subcatchment processing ...
   end
   ```
   - Processes each selected subcatchment.

5. **Nearest Node Calculation**
   - Calculates distances to nodes for each subcatchment.
   - Finds the nearest node overall and the nearest node for each system type.

6. **Node Assignment**
   - Assigns the nearest overall node to `s.node_id`.
   - Assigns the nearest node of each system type to `s.user_text_1` through `s.user_text_6`.

7. **Results Reporting**
   ```ruby
   puts "Number of nodes checked: #{changed_nodes_count}"
   ```
   - Reports the number of nodes processed.

## Workflow
1. Initialize network and collect selected nodes.
2. Begin a transaction.
3. For each selected subcatchment:
   - Calculate distances to all nodes.
   - Find the nearest overall node and assign to `node_id`.
   - Find the nearest node for each system type and assign to respective `user_text` fields.
   - Write changes to the subcatchment.
4. Commit the transaction.
5. Report the number of nodes checked.

## Notes
- The script uses distance calculation based on x and y coordinates.
- It handles multiple system types: storm, foul, sanitary, combined, overland, and other.
- The commented-out line suggests there might have been an intention to match subcatchment and node system types, but it's currently not enforced.
- The script uses `user_text_1` through `user_text_6` fields to store nearest nodes of different system types.
