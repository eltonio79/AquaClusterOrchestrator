# Import cross section data from CSV

This is a two phase process. First a set of new 'cross section line' objects must be created. Once the objects have been created the 'sub-table' can be populated wth the cross section data. This will typically contain X, Y, Z values but may also contain roughness and panel markers.

The Config.cfg should be setup as per the headers for your CSV files. These can be configured and saved through the 'Open Data Import Centre'. The one provided matches the example CSV files.
