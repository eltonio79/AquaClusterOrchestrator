# Populate storage array data

Summary:

1. Define the `array_to_structure` Method:
- This method updates a `WSStructure` object with an array of hashes. It performs sanity checks, adjusts the structure length, and updates the values in each row.

2. Define Storage Data:
- Specify the data to be stored in the storage array. This data is defined as an array of hashes.

3. Start a Transaction:
- Begin a transaction on the current network using `WSApplication.current_network`.

4. Fetch the Row Object and Storage Array Structure:
- Retrieve the row object for a specified node ID ('YourNodeIDHere') from the network.
- Fetch the storage array structure from this row object.

5. Populate the Storage Array:
- Use the `array_to_structure` method to populate the storage array structure with the defined storage data.

Note: The node ID and storage data need to be updated before running the script.
